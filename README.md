# STUDENTS-AI-VS-ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE
“This dashboard analyzes students’ AI usage and its impact on academic performance by combining behavioral, academic, and demographic data.”
The objective of this dashboard is to understand how the use of AI tools influences students’ grades, study efficiency, and screen time, while also identifying patterns across different age groups.
🔹 Overview of the Dashboard
At a high level, the dashboard compares student performance before and after AI adoption, and examines how AI usage interacts with study hours, screen time, and age.
It allows educators, researchers, or decision-makers to quickly assess whether AI is being used productively or excessively.
🔹 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At the top, the KPI cards summarize the most important insights:
Average Screen Time per Day – shows overall digital exposure
Average Study Hours per Day – indicates learning effort
Average Grade Before AI vs After AI – highlights academic change
Grade Improvement – directly measures the impact of AI usage
These KPIs give an immediate snapshot of student behavior and performance outcomes.
🔹 AI Usage and Age Analysis
The visuals AI Tools vs Age and Screen Time vs Age show how AI adoption and screen exposure vary across age groups.
This helps identify:
Which age groups rely most on AI tools
Whether higher AI usage corresponds with increased screen time
🔹 Academic Impact Analysis
The Grades Before vs After AI comparison clearly demonstrates whether students experience improvement after using AI tools.
This is further supported by the Grade Improvement visual, which quantifies the net academic gain.
This section answers the key question:
Does AI usage positively impact student performance?
🔹 Study Efficiency Analysis
The Study Efficiency vs Age visual evaluates how effectively students convert study time into academic performance.
This helps identify:
Age groups that benefit most from AI
Whether AI improves learning efficiency, not just grades
🔹 Insights the Dashboard Enables
Using this dashboard, we can:
Identify positive academic gains linked to AI usage
Detect potential overuse risks related to screen time
Compare study efficiency across age groups
Support data-driven decisions on responsible AI integration in education
